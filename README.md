# 👋 Hi, I’m Vikash

I’m a Computer Technology graduate with hands-on experience in **Machine Learning, Data Analysis, and Applied AI**. I enjoy building practical, end-to-end solutions that combine data processing, model development, and real-world problem solving.

## 🔍 What I Work On
- Machine Learning projects (Supervised & Unsupervised)
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model evaluation and interpretation
- Exploring Generative AI concepts like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

## 🚀 Projects
### 📊 Customer Segmentation (Unsupervised Learning)
- Built a customer segmentation pipeline using clustering techniques.
- Performed data cleaning, preprocessing, and normalization.
- Evaluated clustering quality using methods like Silhouette Score and Elbow Method.

### 🔁 Customer Churn Prediction (Supervised Learning)
- Developed a churn prediction model using historical customer data.
- Handled missing values and feature inconsistencies.
- Evaluated model performance using appropriate classification metrics.

### 🤖 RAG-based Knowledge Assistant (In Progress)
- Building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using LangChain and FAISS.
- Enables document-grounded question answering using Large Language Models.
- Planned deployment using Streamlit and Hugging Face Spaces.

## 🛠️ Skills & Tools
- **Programming:** Python, SQL  
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Feature Engineering  
- **Data:** Data Cleaning, EDA, Model Evaluation  
- **GenAI (Learning):** RAG, Embeddings, Vector Databases  
- **Tools:** Google Colab, Git, GitHub, Streamlit  

## 🎯 Goals
I’m actively seeking **entry-level AI/ML, Data Science, or related roles**, where I can continue learning and contribute to impactful projects.
